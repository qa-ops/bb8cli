These are configuration files which still are valid
bash scripts. They will be loaded from 'load_conf' function
called from a subcommand. The naming convention is:

`subcommand/file`

So if a command like 'url' calls for 'load_conf list' the configuration
will be loaded from 'url/list' to avoid clashing between configurations
and extensions from other subcommands.
